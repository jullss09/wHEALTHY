					<h3>My family don't always understand my depression, but talking is so important</h3>
					<h4> Candice, September 9,2020</h4>
					</p>Growing up in my household was a bit of a struggle. Around the age of 12, I was bullied quite severely, which in turn had an impact on my mental health. I began to experience symptoms of anxiety and depression. I was always a reserved, quiet person but I built up the courage to talk to my mum about how I was feeling</p>

					<h3>When I keep quiet, stigma wins – and I can’t let that happen</h3>
					<h4>Edwin, September 3, 2020</h4>
					</p>Before I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and severe ADHD, I was quite oblivious to mental health issues. Since then, I have gained a much deeper insight on how society views and deals with these issues. I have also come to realise how my words effect the way people interact with me, and how they view me as a person. Words are powerful. Which is why I have said publicly, “when I keep quiet, stigma wins – and I can’t let that happen”.</p>

					<h3>Let’s talk about our hard times...it’s healing</h3>
					<h4> Kelsey, April 30, 2020</h4>
					</p>Depression is debilitating.</p>
					</p>Some people understand it, some think it’s an attention call. For me, depression is like that pile of laundry that you don’t want to show in your Instagram pictures. I never want to show my pile of laundry to the world, I want my life to seem happy and put together, as if I folded and put away all my laundry right out of the dryer.</p>

					<h3>Don't want to date me because I have a mental illness? Your loss!</h3>
					<h4>Claire, September 19, 2019</h4>
					</p>I’ve lived with anxiety and depression along with an eating disorder pretty much as long as I can remember, but understand that that doesn't define me: I am ME.</p>
					</p>I have never really felt stigmatised because of this, and I’m very much a 'take me as I am' person, at least on the outside. Recently though, I had my first blatant experience of stigmatisation, and I’m so angry and shocked I feel I need to speak out about it...</p>

					<h3>Depression is not simple - it's more than being 'sad'</h3>
					<h4>Liz, August 7, 2019</h4>
					</p>I've been suffering from depression for just under four years, and depression has a way of replacing your confidence with pure anxiety and self-hatred. </p>
					</p>The scariest thing I found about suffering from a mental illness is the effect it has on every aspect of your life; it’s not just what’s inside your head. For me, suffering from depression became debilitating as I couldn't find happiness in the little things I used to enjoy doing. More often than not, depression would cause me to sit in my room and cry, usually for no reason at all.</p>
